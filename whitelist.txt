Whitelist
IT manages the whitelist to handle exceptions for applocking at Windows and prevent UAC requests to user.
This can be done either by certificate, or a wildcard based rule for the exe file 

Check applocking
Check applocking with EventViewer - Application and services logs - Microsoft - Windows - Applocker [exe/dll/msi/script]
After IT has updated whitelist with a new rule, update  Policies by running gpupdate /force
